this project is a react app i created to practice javascript, css, and working with the open-source maplibre library.

# day trip: laguna beach

recently, i went on a day trip with some friends to laguna beach and i remembered stressing out the few nights before planning what i wanted to do there. taking inspiration from that experience, i thought it would be fun to create a map-based application that has a list of recommended places to visit and itinerary list a user can add to.

# things i plan to add

1: images of the locations when the user hovers over the rotating buttons
2: expand the website to have a dropdown menu with other day-trip-locations i have itinerary recommendations for
3: find a better map
