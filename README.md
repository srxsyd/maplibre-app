# day trip: laguna beach

recently, i went on a day trip with some friends to laguna beach and i remembered stressing out the few nights before planning what i wanted to do there. taking inspiration from that experience, i thought it would be fun to create a map-based application that has a list of recommended places to visit and itinerary list a user can add to.
